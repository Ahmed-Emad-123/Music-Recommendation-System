# Music-Recommendation-System

## Basic Overview:
This Music Recommendation System leverages machine learning algorithms to suggest music tracks to users based on their preferences and listening history. The system is built using Python and popular libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, and scikit-learn. The ANN model achieves an accuracy of 66%, while the Logistic Regression model achieves an accuracy of 55%.

## Features:
+ **Personalized Recommendations**:
  - Generates music recommendations tailored to individual user preferences.
+ **User-Friendly Interface**:
  - Simple and intuitive interface for users to interact with the system.
+ **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Utilizes ANN and Logistic Regression for recommendation predictions.
+ **Data Handling**:
  - Efficiently processes and handles large music datasets.
